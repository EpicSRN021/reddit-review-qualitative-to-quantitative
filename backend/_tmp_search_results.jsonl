Although it's good to see that the brakes aren't as bad as Throttle house said. You could make a case that lap times don't really matter, but if we're talking about ultimate performance sedans, personally I think it does. Mostly bragging rights sure, but I still think the extra performance means something in this category of cars.\n\nAll that said, I'll have to agree with the conclusion, but I'm biased because I have a Boxster S and a Model 3.

As a current owner of a M4 Competition X-Drive who's lapped this very same track, Streets Of Willow, it was especially interesting to watch the comparison with the Model 3 Performance.  It's quite impressive, even if it's slower around the track, how far Tesla has come catering to high performance track driving.  15-20 minutes is the typical session length, so it's not quite on par with lap-to-lap consistency yet.  For Autocross or Time Attack, however, the Model 3 will be much more competitive.  The biggest drawback is that you need to charge the car between sessions, and depending on how the day is scheduled, that might not possible.  Open lapping days are also not ideal for Tesla, as you will get much less seat time wasted on charging.\n\n  \nAs a daily driver, the Model 3, I think, wins in most aspects, but I have issues with Cammisa's iDrive criticisms.  Maybe I've been living with iDrive for too long (through 2 generations - 2 F80 M3's and 3 years behind a G82 M4), but with everything setup on the radio and carplay, the iDrive is not an issue.  Not to mention that the HUD makes it so you don't even have to look at the screen to change stations.  \n\n  \nPrice. My G82 was $97k without the carbon seats and braes, it's not cheap.  It's twice the price of the Tesla Model 3 Performance.  The argument being that you can get a Miata or GR86 as a track toy.  Those cars aren't nearly as fast as the M3, but... they will be much slower than both the Tesla and the BMW.  Granted they are both probably more fun!  So do you want to have more fun, or be faster, or is being faster more fun?  So there is a compromise.  The M3 is the argument for 1 car that does it all.  \n\n  \nEither way, the Tesla is quite impressive. Since there will be a day in the near future where an ICE M3 won't even be an option, it's encouraging to see EV evolve into soulful mororsports machines, despite the lack of noise.", "score": 14, "created_utc": 1731612803.0, "parent_id": "t3_1gr5kng", "author_link_karma": null, "author_comment_karma": null, "comment_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1gr5kng/jason_and_randy_review_the_new_bmw_m3_and_tesla/lx4wkgi"}, {"id": "lx4c8lb", "author": null, "body": "Shameless brag incoming.
