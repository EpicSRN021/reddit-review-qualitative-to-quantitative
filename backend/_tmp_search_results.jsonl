Due to the respect for marriage act passed by congress in 2022, If obergefell is overruled, then all states will still be required to recognize gay marriages.

Their marriage would still be legal and have all the same rights as a straight couple. However, they couldn't have gotten married in Alabama. \n\nOverturning obergefell on its own won't make gay marriage totally illegal in any part of the country. It will just limit where you can have it done. To completely ban it, they would then have to say the respect for marriage act is unconstitutional.

My suspicion is that while *firm* support for same-sex marriage has grown, and the *opposed* population has reduced, the remaining \"meh\" group is going to be pretty \"meh\" whereas earlier they were casually supportive.\n\n2 - What will the court rule? The court will most likely rule that clerks can decline to provide services for couples. It is unlikely that the right to marry will be revoked, at least not based on this particular case, but given the past decisions of these Justices I can foresee them agreeing with the plaintiff that individuals can decline to provide the services their jobs require of them based on nothing more than personal convictions.\n\n3 - How will the public react? If the ruling is that clerks can individually decide, the response will be very different (and much more subdued) as compared to if a state or county can refuse to issue to anyone they don't want to. The former is a much more nuanced segregation or discrimination issue that forces some people to seek out a second clerk; finding a second clerk is peanuts in a larger-population county or state, but for some couples it could mean travelling for hours to find someone who will do the deed. If a state or county refuses, however, that is a *much* bigger issue, especially if they also refuse to recognize marriages done in other states.\n\n  \n\\-\n\nAfter the abortion issue came to its current form (state level whatever), that is all but certainly going to be used as a model by which other \"culture wars\" issues can be broken down.

But there are so many wonderful games that aren't like that and that have different gameplay loops or are just really short gems.\n\n_Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons_ is an absolutely amazing game despite its simplicity, and it hits emotionally like a punch to the gut.\n\n_Myst_ is a game that keeps getting remade and was so far ahead of its era, but is still beloved by people who are into those games. If that one hasn't gotten a 10/10 at some point, what hardcore puzzle mystery game possibly can?\n\nOr how about either of the _Portal_ games? Both have become iconic for the tongue-in-cheek tone and being groundbreaking for their era.

Stardew Valley?\n\nIt's great that we've got Hades on the list, but where are the Metroidvania's? How about Hollow Knight?

Oh right, they were probably too simple at the time of their release, but they were beloved like crazy and are still heavily played today!\n\nI could go on for days and days about things like _Guitar Hero_/_Rock Band_, _The Sims_, _Rollercoaster Tycoon_, _Street Fighter_/_Mortal Kombat_, _Inscryption_ and so many more games that are iconic, beloved and replayable.\n\nThis list is just a Nintendo, Rockstar & publisher company AAA-budget glorification list. Except for Hades, which feels like it is on that list just to make it seem like the list is a bit more realistic.\n\nHell, it blows my mind that there is somehow not a single Fallout or Elder Scrolls title there. Buggy games, sure, but let's not pretend GTA and Zelda games don't have their fair share of crazy jank.\n\nNot every game is for everyone, but it is blindly clear that these magazines exist as PR firms adding into marketing hype more-so than independent reviewing outlets who review games on their individual merits.", "score": 35, "created_utc": 1759149570.0, "parent_id": "t3_1ntcweb", "author_link_karma": null, "author_comment_karma": null, "comment_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1ntcweb/games_that_have_been_rated_a_perfect_1010_by_the/ngtgs5m"}, {"id": "ngt4o0s", "author": "Vegetable-Dog5281", "body": "Half life 2 not being on here is silly", "score": 25, "created_utc": 1759144520.0, "parent_id": "t3_1ntcweb", "author_link_karma": null, "author_comment_karma": null, "comment_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1ntcweb/games_that_have_been_rated_a_perfect_1010_by_the/ngt4o0s"}, {"id": "ngsujaq", "author": "Liquoricezoku", "body": "What was imperfect about Clair Obscur?
