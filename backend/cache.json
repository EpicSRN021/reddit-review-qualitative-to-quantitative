Many find the base M4 Pro/Pro-level MacBook Pro a very noticeable step up from the Air.\n- Strengths: excellent display, more ports, strong real-world performance, good value at the base spec with 16GB RAM.\n- Caveats: 16GB is fine now but may feel limiting years down the road if you plan to keep the machine a long time or do heavy pro work. Some users recommend upgrading to a higher-tier chip (M4 Pro) or more RAM/storage for future-proofing.\n- Other practical note: Space Black finishes have reports of chipping and show fingerprints/dust \u2014 choose color accordingly.\n- Recommendation: Buy the base if you want great value and current performance.

So if battery life is a priority, expect roughly ~10 hours in real use from this small sample; check more reviews or official specs for a reliable estimate before buying."}
